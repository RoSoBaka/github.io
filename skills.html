				<h2>Playing The Guitar</h2>
				<p>As a kid, I always wanted to learn how to play the guitar, and since the 
				age of 13, I have learned how to play and still am continuing to play the guitar.
				Since I'am a big fan of listening to music, the guitar was always my favorite instrument
				to listen during songs. Almost been playing the guitar for 9 years and i do not have any
				plans of stopping.</p>

				<h2>Web Design</h2>
				<p>When I was studying back in The Netherlands, I had a course on which we learned
				how to make a website, thus this is how I have learned to design a website.
				My knowledge of making a website is one of a beginners, I only know how to
				make a simple website with good knowledge of HTML and CSS and very little 
				of Javascript. In the futurue I would like to learn more about Javascript
				and expand the languages of coding.</p>

				<h2>Singing</h2>
				<p>When I knew how to play the guitar, I had realized that singing also became
				an option as to progress my knowledge for music and so I did. I had started singing
				just after i started to play the guitar, somewhere around the age of 14. My singing as
				of this moment is not at 100%, since after graduating high school I took a break.</p>
